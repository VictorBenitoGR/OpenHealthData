The intelligent collection, cleaning, processing and visualization of data is an indispensable process for the efficient, precise, productive and sharp **self-criticism** of any project. 

This project seeks to capture several performance variables of the health sector, including waiting times, rescheduling, treatment and follow-up of each citizen, generating a digital medical profile that promotes and facilitates the use and census of health services, taking into consideration the quantitative and qualitative state of the facilities, supplies and different types of employees.

## Background
This project started as a personal initiative during my university career at Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM), who has agreements with several companies to facilitate students the development of projects attacking the specific problems they have (in this case Teleton CRIT Morelia).
